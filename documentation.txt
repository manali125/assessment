Tools used:
Sublime text, Chrome Developer tools, GitHub

Web Development languages:
HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, Vanilla JavaScript(Plain)

Functionality:
4 blue buttons are to notify the required coins.
Inout field is for user to input a value after clicking on Calculate button.

The JavaScript code runs in a way that, when user enters a coin,
the code checks if the value is less than 25 or greater than 25.
And accordingly, if value is less than 25, the coin required starts from penny.nickels or
dimes and if greater than 25, it starts from quarters.

For, notifying on the 4 blue buttons, notify.js is implemented but it is not working as
expected.
So, for now, I am displaying the results, I have used a <p> tag.

E.g:

If user enters 18
Output is: Required coins is 1 dime 1 nickel and 3 pennies
